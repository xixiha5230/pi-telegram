# Documentation Index

> Descriptive reference for the current code; it describes, it does not rule.
> Binding rules live in [`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md).

Living index of project documentation in `/docs`.

> Developer note: Pi executes the generated `dist/pi-telegram/index.js` entrypoint. After any project edit, run `npm run build` before `/reload`, restart, or live verification; otherwise the runtime can continue using stale compiled output.

`public-api.md` is the canonical entrypoint for stable extension surfaces. Focused documents exist only when a surface has enough runtime rules to need a dedicated standard.
